Best Practice of Unit Test
 Isolated / Stand-alone
  seperated from any other dependencies such as file system or database

 Test single method at-a-time
  should not test more than one method in a single test case

 Unordered
  can be executed in any order

 Fast
  tests should take little time to run (about few milliseconds)

 Repeatable
  tests can run repeatedly but should give same result, if no changes in the actual source code

 Timely
  time taken for writing a test case should not take longer time than the time taken for writing code that is being tested
