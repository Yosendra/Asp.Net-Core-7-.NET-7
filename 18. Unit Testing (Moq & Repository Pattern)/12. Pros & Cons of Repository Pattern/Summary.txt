Benefit of Repository Pattern
  Lossely-Coupled business logic (service) and data accsss logic. 
  We can independently develop them.

  Changing data store
  We can easily change our application database, for example from SQL server to PostgreSQL
  Not affecting business logic. We just only need to implement the repository interface used in the service.
  We can create alternative repository implementation for another data store when needed

  Unit testing
  Mocking the repository is much easier (and preferred) than mocking DbContext

Non-Benefit of Repository Pattern
  It adds one layer in our application architecture design
