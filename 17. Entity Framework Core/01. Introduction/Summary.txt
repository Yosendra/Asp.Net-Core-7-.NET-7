Entity Framework Core
  is light-weight, extensible and cross-platform framework for accessing databases in .NET applications.
  It is the most-used database framework for Asp.Net Core Apps.

EFCore Model

  Model class                                          Database Table

  public class ModelClass
  {                                                    Table
     public DataType PropertyName1 { get; set; } ----> - ColumnName1
     public DataType PropertyName2 { get; set; } ----> - ColumnName2
  }

Pros & Cons of EFcore
- Shorter Code
  The CRUD operations / calling stored procedure are done with shorter amount of code than ADO.NET
- Strongly-Typed
  The columns as created properties in model class. 
  So the intellisense offers columns of the table as peroperties, while writing the code.
  Plus, the developer need not convert data type of values, it's automatically done by EFCore itself.
- Performance
  EFCore performs slower than ADO.NET
  So ADO.NET or its alternatives (such as Dapper) are recommended for larger & high-traffic applications.
